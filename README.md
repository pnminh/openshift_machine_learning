## Run notebooks on Openshift
1. Install Open Data Hub [beta](https://opendatahub.io/docs/getting-started/quick-installation.html) or [legacy](https://opendatahub.io/docs/getting-started/legacy/quick-installation.html) into working namespace.   
**Note: At the time of the installation, using beta channel did not work. The legacy method worked fine. 
2. Create [jupyterhub environment from git repo](Starting%20with%20the%20ml-workflows%20ODH%20Environment%20v2.pdf)    
**Note: In case we need to install a new notebook image, go to `Control Panel > Stop my server`
